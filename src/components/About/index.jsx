            <br/><br/>I am an ex-soldier who decided to learn how to code, I started by learning very basic Java and C# through self-practice and YouTube tutorials. I found the problem solving to be very rewarding and always felt an extreme sense of accomplishment when I finished a project so I decided to take it a step further and sign up to the Monash Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp.</p>
